Prediction Market (Educational & Experimental Project)
This repository provides a minimal proof-of-concept prediction market with an automated market maker built using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and a simple HTML/JS frontend.
It follows the original system design outlined in the accompanying notes and serves as a learning and experimentation toolkit, not for profit or real trading.

⚠️ Disclaimer & Acknowledgment
This project is for educational and experimental purposes only.
All markets, balances, and outcomes are virtual and have no monetary value.
It is not a platform for investment, gambling, or profit-making.

Development involved the use of AI tools including ChatGPT for brainstorming, debugging, and documentation support.
All outputs were reviewed and refined by the author to ensure technical accuracy and educational value.

✨ Features
User registration & login with hashed passwords and a virtual starting balance.
Market creation via an admin endpoint (see frontend/admin.html).
LMSR automated market maker powering binary markets with continuous liquidity and dynamic pricing.
Bet placement with balance checks and LMSR-based cost functions.
Market resolution with payout logic for winning shares and price freeze after close.
User portal displaying balances, transactions, and claimable daily bonuses.
CORS-enabled API for flexible backend/frontend hosting.
Frontend visualization for price history and market expiration times.

⚙️ Getting Started
1. Backend Setup
Create and activate a virtual environment:

cd prediction-market/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure your database:

Default: local SQLite at ./market.db

Optional (PostgreSQL):

export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@hostname:5432/dbname"
Run the server:

uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Access API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

2. Frontend Setup
The frontend is static and can be opened directly or hosted anywhere (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).

To connect to your backend, update the following line in frontend/script.js:

const apiBase = 'https://your-backend.onrender.com';
Then open frontend/index.html in your browser to register, log in, browse, and place trades.

🧩 Example Functionality
Create or view binary markets with expiration timestamps.
Place YES/NO bets with LMSR-based cost updates.
View your transaction and balance history.
Claim a daily reward (50 credits every 23 hours if balance ≤ 500).
Admins can resolve or delete expired markets.
💡 Next Steps (Suggested Enhancements)
Add JWT-based authentication for session security.
Include leaderboard and user performance analytics.
Enable multi-outcome markets.
Integrate real-time chart updates (WebSocket or polling).
Deploy via Render (backend) + Vercel or GitHub Pages (frontend).
🧠 Learning Focus
This project demonstrates:

The LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) market-maker formula
Integration of FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + JS frontend
Time-based expiration and balance logic
Clean REST API design for learning web development concepts
Ethical, AI-assisted experimentation in open-source environments
